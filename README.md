# NotepadApp_Java

This is an implementation of a basic (even rudimentary) notepad application developed using Java Swings.

The project was developed using NetBeans 8, and I suppose that should explain all the boilerplate code in there.

The actual file you should focus on is src/notepadapplication/Notepad.java
